## About

This repository is a centralized collection of Roblox scripts Iâ€™ve developed to enhance gameplay, automate tasks, or add new features within Roblox games.  
Scripts are written in **Lua**, Robloxâ€™s scripting language.

## Usage

To use any of these scripts:

1. Download or clone the repo.  
2. Open your Roblox Studio project.  
3. Insert the script files into the appropriate places in your game hierarchy (e.g., ServerScriptService or StarterPlayerScripts).  
4. Customize script settings as needed.  
5. Test in Roblox Studio or in-game.
